Requirements:
  Python 3

Simply run midi2piano.py and choose midi file you want to convert.
The &quot;sheet music&quot; will be copied to the clipboard.

There are some constants defined at the top of midi2piano.py.

TICK_LAG - CHANGE THIS VALUE TO TICK LAG OF YOUR SERVER!

Change their value if needed.

LINE_LENGTH_LIM - max length of line allowed in the sheet music
LINES_LIMIT - max amount of lines allowed in the sheet music. Extra lines will be cropped.

OVERALL_IMPORT_LIM - max amount of characters allowed in the sheet music.


You can also transpose music if you need to
OCTAVE_TRANSPOSE - amount of octaves you melody will be shifted by
FLOAT_PRECISION - read comment

Additional notes:
1. Unlike previous midi2piano, this tool optimizes sheet music to fit more in less lines. 
2. If two notes are less than 50 ms apart, they are chorded. BYOND works in  1/10th of a second so 50 ms is time quanta.
4. MIDI event set_tempo is NOT supported. If your MIDI file uses set_tempo to change BPM significantly, consider using some other midi file.

This tool is considered final.
