  BlueWildrose:

  - balance: Stabilized orange extracts can only cool by -5 degrees per tick base
      instead of by as much as the difference is.
  - balance: "Stabilized orange extracts only have halved cooling effects on Synthetics\
      \ (2.5 per status tick / 5 per life), but also cool them towards ~-100\xB0C\
      \ instead of base bodytemp."
  - balance: The Space Adaptation mutation when applied to Synthetics now nullifies
      the penalty for passive cooling if in low-pressure environments.

      reasonably be destroyed
  - balance: Ashwalkers get one life, and have a 40% chance to earn an additional
      life when they sacrifice to the tendril.
