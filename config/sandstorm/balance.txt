TETRIS_REWARD_DIVISOR 1000

## Minimum score required to message admins
## This is intended for detecting suspicious scores
TETRIS_SCORE_HIGH 10000

## Maximum score that can be displayed
## Score values past this number are ignored
TETRIS_SCORE_MAX 100000

## Maximum research points that can be generated
## Score values past this number are ignored
TETRIS_SCORE_MAX_SCI 10000

## Minimum time between giving rewards
## This applies to both prizes and research points
## Time is measured in ticks
